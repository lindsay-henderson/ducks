# AVI
AVI is an app for birders that gives them a place to connect.  They can track the birds they have seen, share birding events, ask birding questions, and create supply lists for the various birding trips they may go on.  Birders of a feather flock together!

***

## Instructions:
* Navigate to the AVI app.
* Sign up for an account.
* Login to the app.
* User will be routed to the landing page.
* By clicking on 'Birders" in the nav bar, the user can view the profiles of other birders.
* Clicking on 'Birds', the user has the ability to add 'seen' and 'wishlist' birds to their lists.
* Clicking on 'Supply Lists' gives the user the ability to create supply lists for when they travel for birding.
* Clicking on 'Events' allows the user to view an existing list of birding events from all users, as well as giving a user the ability to create a new event.
* Clicking on 'Field Notes' brings users to a Questions forum, where they can respond to existing birding questions and post questions of their own.
* Users can click 'Log Out' to exit the app.
